Files   
  
• CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data   
• run_analysis.R performs preparation of the data according to the assignment requirements:   
  
o Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.   
o Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measure
ment.   
o Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set   
o Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
o From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each s
ubject.   
  
• final_data.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
